The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a data access protocol created by Microsoft that builds on simple REST principles. Your task is to retrieve certain data from a sample (live) OData service.

For this problem you will be working with the OData service located here (http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/). You will retrieve data from an entity set called ‘Products’. An entity set is equivalent to a table in a relational database. The Products entity set is located here (http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/Products).

Your input file will consist of a series of simple queries to perform on the Products entity set. The input will contain a $filter expression to perform on Products. This is equivalent to a WHERE clause in SQL. Your job is simply to see how many entities (rows in a table) are returned from the specified query.

Normally a request to the endpoint specified above would return product data - but since you are only interested in the number of entities that would be returned, you can send requests to this special $count endpoint
(http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/Products/$count). After sending an appropriate request to this endpoint, it will respond with the number of entities that match the query. Print out this value on a line in the output file. Your output file will have one line per line of input containing one number.
Input description/format

The input will be a series of $filter queries to perform. Each line of input will correspond to a single query.

For instance, the input line:
Discontinued eq true

should send a GET request to the following URL: http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/Products/$count?$filter=Discontinued eq true
Output description/format

Your output will be a single number per line of input, indicating how many entities match the given query.
Example input

Discontinued eq true
SupplierID eq 4
CategoryID eq 2

Example output

8
3
12
